                    <p>
                        Delchi grew up on a small farm in Boulder County. His early experiences with engineering, starting at age 5 or so, included elaborate tree forts, deep tunneling excavations, and other mechanical inventions. As a high school student, he enrolled in the Building Trades program at Front Range Community College, now Boulder TEC. As a boy, he pursued service opportunities and part-time work in construction locally and in Mexico.

                        <br>
                        He enrolled in the Architectural Engineering program at CU Boulder to pursue his interest in the building industry, where he discovered a delightful interest in formal engineering sciences and applied mathematics. After graduation with a minor in math, he helped build a log cabin in Israel and then began structural engineering in Boulder. He eventually returned to CU for a master’s of science in structural engineering.
